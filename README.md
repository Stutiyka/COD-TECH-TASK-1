Overview of the Project

Project:Create a simple to-do list app where users can add tasks, mark them as complete, and
delete them.

Objective:
To create an intuitive to-do list application that could be used to add tasks, mark some as complete, and delete others, we could extend the preceding code to add the functionality to mark as complete. In this version of the application:
1)Tasks can be added.
2)Tasks can be marked as complete, which will strike through the task. Tasks can be deleted.

Key Activities:

1. Class Creation (ToDoList):
This holds the core functionality of the to-do app, which includes adding tasks, marking them as complete, deletion of tasks, and showing all tasks.

2. Task Addition (add_task):
Adds tasks to the list as a dictionary with keys 'task' and 'completed'.

3. Mark a Task Completed (mark_complete):
Set the completion status of a task to be True, meaning it has been completed.

4. Deleting a Task (delete_task): Removes a specific task based on its index from the list.

5. Display Tasks (show_tasks):
It displays all tasks in the list with checkmarks for completed tasks and crosses for incomplete tasks.

Technologies used:
Python: The core programming language for building the logic of the app.
Data Structures: Lists and dictionaries handle task storage and task information.
Control Structures: if statements, loops (while and for), and function definitions provide the app's flow and decision-making.
